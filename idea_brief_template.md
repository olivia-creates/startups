# Minimal Idea Brief

Use this lightweight brief to capture just enough signal before investing time in a full idea spec. Keep it to 1–2 pages.

## 1) Title + One‑liner
- Working name:
- One‑liner (what it does / for whom):

## 2) Problem (max 3 bullets)
- What’s broken or underserved?
- Who feels the pain most?
- Evidence or anecdote (link/notes):

## 3) Who + Where
- Primary user/customer:
- Context/location (if local or geo‑specific):
- Willingness to pay (rough):

## 4) Why Now (1–2 bullets)
- Timing/cultural/tech/regulatory shifts enabling this:

## 5) Solution Hypothesis (3–5 lines max)
- What’s the core experience? What’s intentionally out of scope for v0?

## 6) Differentiation (1–2 bullets)
- Why us / why this approach?

## 7) Key Assumptions (3–5)
- Assumption → How we’ll test quickly:

## 8) Risks & Unknowns (top 3)
- Risk → Mitigation idea:

## 9) Feasibility (quick rubric)
- Tech: 1–5 | Data: 1–5 | GTM: 1–5 | Ops: 1–5 | Team fit: 1–5
- Biggest feasibility blocker:

## 10) Revenue Model (one line)
- Pricing/monetization you’d try first:

## 11) Success Metrics (pick three)
- Metric 1 (leading):
- Metric 2 (behavioral):
- Metric 3 (business):

## 12) Validation Plan (7–14 days)
- Tests/interviews you’ll run:
- What decision will results inform?

## 13) GTM Wedge (one channel)
- The single highest‑conviction channel to reach first users (and why):

## 14) Data/Inputs to Pull (if relevant)
- Datasets/benchmarks you’ll check to sanity‑test TAM/SAM/SOM or ops:

## 15) Rough Effort & Cost
- Effort: S / M / L | Key dependencies:

## 16) Next Steps (checklist)
- [ ] Draft brief (this document)
- [ ] 3–5 customer interviews or signals
- [ ] Prototype or storyboard (1–2 days)
- [ ] Back‑of‑napkin unit economics
- [ ] Go/No‑go meeting

## 17) Promotion Criteria (to full idea spec)
Promote this brief to the full startup_ideas template when:
- You have ≥3 credible signals (interviews, intent, early partner)
- A plausible initial revenue model (+ rough unit economics)
- One clear GTM wedge to test
- Feasibility looks ≥3/5 across key dimensions
