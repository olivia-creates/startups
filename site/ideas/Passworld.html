  <main class="container"><p><h2>Dropin</h2></p><p>Turn every café into a co-working space.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>❌ The Problem</h3></p><p> Remote work is the new normal: \~23% of U.S. employees (36M people) work remotely at least part-time【Backlinko】. Globally, hybrid models are here to stay.  
 In Q1 2025, 41% of U.S. jobs featured some form of remote work—24% hybrid and 13% fully remote. That’s up significantly from just 10% remote two years earlier.[Oyster HR+6Robert Half+6StrongDM+6](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/research/remote-work-statistics-and-trends?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</p><p> Telework remains prominent: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that as of Q1 2024, nearly 22.9% of workers performed some telework, up from 21.5% in early 2023\.</p><p> Cafés are under strain:</p><p>   Unlimited Wi-Fi freeloading → squatters block seats without buying.</p><p>   Strict time caps → frustrate paying customers mid-session.</p><p>   Dry logins → miss opportunities to upsell, retain, or build community.</p><p> Result: lost revenue per seat, reduced turnover, and customers feeling unwanted.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💡 The Insight</h3></p><p>Every café seat is valuable real estate.  
 With the right system, cafés can become micro co-working spaces — balancing turnover, boosting revenues, and fostering community while addressing the loneliness crisis among remote workers.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🚀 The Solution: Dropin</h3></p><p>Dropin transforms café Wi-Fi into a pay-to-stay coworking system:</p><p>For Customers:</p><p> Buy a drink → unlock Wi-Fi for 1.5 hours.</p><p> 5 mins before expiry: a friendly pop-up offers to:</p><p>   Add more time with a micro-payment to extend wifi time, or</p><p>   Order a snack/drink (delivered to your seat) to extend time proportionally to amount paid.</p><p> Optional café chat with a forum or Slack-like network → connect with other remote workers, fostering friendships and networking.</p><p>For Cafés:</p><p> Control seat usage with flexible time tiers.</p><p> Increase sales through upsells tied to Wi-Fi & seating.</p><p> Turn empty Wi-Fi into recurring coworking revenue.</p><p> Build loyalty and community around the café brand.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🔥 Why It Works</h3></p><p> Stops freeloading, honors paying customers.</p><p> Boosts profit per square foot: a latte \+ a croissant mid-session doubles average ticket.</p><p> Loyalty & community: patrons feel like members, not just transactions.</p><p> Scalable: No need for new furniture or staffing, just software.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🌍 Market Opportunity</h3></p><p> Global Café Market: $321.5B in 2024 → $455.5B by 2033 (CAGR \~3.5%).</p><p> Global Coffee Market: $284.8B in 2025 → $369.5B by 2030 (CAGR \~5.3%).</p><p> Coworking Market: $16.3B in 2023 → $24B+ by 2030 (CAGR \~5–6%).</p><p> Loneliness Costs: \~$400B lost annually in productivity worldwide. Dropin reframes cafés as social infrastructure.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💰 Business Model</h3></p><p> SaaS subscription: $50–$200/month per café.</p><p> Revenue share: % on digital upsells (food, drink, time extensions).</p><p> Premium plan: analytics, loyalty programs, advanced upsell automation.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⚙️ Implementation Strategy</h3></p><p>1. Pilot Program: 5–10 independent cafés in remote-friendly hubs (Montreal, Austin, Lisbon).</p><p>2. POS Partnerships: Integrate with Toast, Square, Lightspeed → instant onboarding for thousands of cafés.</p><p>3. Regional Chains: Target Second Cup, Blue Bottle, Pret.</p><p>4. Community Layer: Position Dropin as part of the solution to loneliness \+ productivity. Partner with coworking associations or mental health orgs.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💵 Unit Economics</h3></p><p> Setup: \~$500 per café (router config \+ onboarding).</p><p> SaaS: $50–$200 monthly.</p><p> Revenue uplift: \+1 extra item per table/day → \~$10–15K additional revenue annually per café.</p><p> Higher seat turnover \= more customers served per day.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⏳ Why Now</h3></p><p> Remote & hybrid work are entrenched.</p><p> Cafés face cost pressure → need new revenue streams.</p><p> Loneliness epidemic is real → cafés can become community hubs again.</p><p> Dropin bridges all three: profit, productivity, and people.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>✨ Tagline</h3></p><p>“Dropin — Your pass to work, connect, and belong.”</p><p>Could extend it beyond coffee shops, a mutli service wifi network that connects people, workers, beyond just having wifi as a cheap commodity with weird password. </p><p>The password used can be designed and sold as an ad: “Caramelfrappucino” \- makes you want to buy it, or think of it at least.</p><p></p></main>
