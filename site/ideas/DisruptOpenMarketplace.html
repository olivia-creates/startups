The Problem</h3></p><p>Portfolio companies within VC ecosystems struggle with distribution and sales, especially as they face workforce reductions. Talented employees are being let go despite having valuable networks and existing expertise of the products, brands, and goodwill towards the company. Meanwhile, companies have great products but limited reach to potential customers. The traditional approach of maintaining large sales teams is becoming increasingly expensive and unsustainable.</p><p><h3>üí° 2. The Insight</h3></p><p>The rise of individual content creators and personal brands creates an untapped opportunity. Former employees and ecosystem participants have networks and credibility that could be leveraged for product distribution. Instead of viewing workforce reductions as purely negative, we can transform them into distributed sales opportunities with win-win revenue sharing.</p><p><h3>üöÄ 3. The Solution</h3></p><p>An open marketplace platform specifically for VC portfolio companies that enables:
<ul><li>Ridiculously simple affiliate link creation with pre-determined revenue share percentages to streamline "influencer" deal creation</li></ul>
<ul><li>Marketing asset libraries for each product (pitch decks, copy, visuals, testimonials)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pitch-ready product information and training materials</li></ul>
<ul><li>Individual dashboard for tracking performance and earnings</li></ul>
<ul><li>Seamless onboarding for anyone connected to the ecosystem (employees, alumni, advisors, customers)</li></ul></p><p>
**Brand Guidelines & Asset Kits (per product)**
<ul><li>Clear, per‚Äëproduct brand guides: tone of voice, do/don‚Äôts, approved claims, logo/visual usage</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pre‚Äëapproved copy blocks, visuals, and video snippets for easy, on‚Äëbrand sharing</li></ul>
<ul><li>Disclosure and link rules: UTM conventions, affiliate disclosures, jurisdictional disclaimers</li></ul>
<ul><li>Auto‚Äëformatted assets for major channels (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, email, ads)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Usage rights, localization variants, and expiry/refresh cycles managed centrally</li></ul>
<ul><li>Optional pre‚Äëpublish checks and brand approvals for sensitive categories</li></ul></p><p><h3>‚ú® 4. Why It Works</h3></p><p><ul><li>**Emotional Hook**: Provides income opportunity for displaced workers while helping companies they believe in</li></ul>
<ul><li>**Network Effects**: Ecosystem participants already have trust and context around the products</li></ul>
<ul><li>**Low Friction**: Simple tools remove barriers to becoming an effective affiliate</li></ul>
<ul><li>**Mutual Benefit**: Companies get distributed sales force, individuals get entrepreneurial income stream</li></ul></p><p><h3>‚è≥ 5. Why Now</h3></p><p><ul><li>AI is solving production capacity, but distribution remains a key challenge</li></ul>
<ul><li>Individual entrepreneurship and creator economy are at all-time highs</li></ul>
<ul><li>Economic pressures forcing companies to reduce headcount while maintaining growth</li></ul>
<ul><li>Social media and content creation tools make anyone capable of reaching audiences</li></ul>
<ul><li>Trust in personal recommendations over corporate marketing continues to grow</li></ul></p><p>---</p><p><h3>üìä 6. Market Opportunity</h3></p><p><ul><li>**TAM**: $50B+ global affiliate marketing market</li></ul>
