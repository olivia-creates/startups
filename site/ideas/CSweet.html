<h1>**CSweet**</h1></p><p><h3>Meet the world's best minds.</h3></p><p>---</p><p><h3>❌ 1. The Problem</h3></p><p>Breakthrough growth often demands elite strategic thinking — but the world's top C-level talent is locked inside billion-dollar companies, inaccessible to the rest of us. Hiring them full-time costs millions, and advisory boards offer limited engagement. The result? Early-stage and mid-size companies hit growth ceilings they can't break.</p><p>**Proof points:**
* 87% of startups cite lack of strategic guidance as a top growth barrier
* Average Fortune 500 CEO compensation: $15.6M annually
* Advisory board engagement averages 4-6 hours monthly per advisor
* Management consulting costs $200-500/hour with 6-week minimum engagements</p><p>---</p><p><h3>💡 2. The Insight</h3></p><p>What if you could hire the minds of the most brilliant executives alive — trained AI superagents modeled after their decision-making, strategies, and instincts? Months of deep mentorship captured in an AI you can brief, brainstorm with, and deploy instantly.</p><p>**The overlooked truth:** Elite executive thinking isn't just experience — it's pattern recognition, decision frameworks, and strategic intuition that can be distilled and replicated through AI.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>🚀 3. The Solution</h3></p><p>CSweet is a marketplace of AI superagents trained on the playbooks, frameworks, and intuition of the world's best CEOs, CMOs, CFOs, and more. **Each superagent is co-built with the actual executive, distilled from months of collaboration, interviews, and scenario testing.**</p><p>**Core Features:**
* **Executive AI Agents**: Trained on specific C-level executives' decision-making patterns
* **Instant Briefing**: Upload your business context and get tailored strategic advice
* **Scenario Planning**: Run "what-if" analyses with different executive perspectives
* **Strategy Sessions**: Multi-hour deep dives with your chosen executive AI
* **Cross-functional Teams**: Assemble virtual C-suites for complex decisions</p><p>Hire them by the hour, day, or project — no equity, no long contracts.</p><p>**Partnered Thought‑Leader Model (MasterClass‑style supply)**
We co‑build branded agents with recognized executives and institutions who already have brand, credibility, and followings. Like MasterClass used name recognition to lift ad performance and conversion, CSweet leverages executive and institutional brands to drive trust and distribution. Example: many companies would love to hire Imran Sayeed (MIT) but can’t afford his fees or add him to their board — they can “rent his brain” through his agent; the MIT association amplifies distribution and conversion.</p><p>**Supply Strategy (Priority Targets)**
* Seasoned executives with strong operator cred (e.g., ex‑FAANG VPs, Fortune 500 division heads)
* Institution‑anchored thought leaders (MIT, Stanford, Wharton, INSEAD, Oxford)
* Functional icons by domain (product, growth, finance, ops, brand)
* Diversity of perspectives (industry, geography, background) for breadth and inclusivity
**Founding Cohort (Illustrative Targets)**
<ul><li>Mudassir Sheikha — Co-founder & CEO, Careem (rides, super app, ops scaling)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sir Tim Clark — President, Emirates Airline (global aviation, network strategy)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Paul Griffiths — CEO, Dubai Airports (hub ops, capacity planning)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem — Group Chairman & CEO, DP World (logistics, ports)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Mohamed Alabbar — Founder, Emaar & Noon (real estate + e‑commerce)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Huda Kattan — Founder, Huda Beauty (brand, DTC, creator distribution)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Noor Sweid — Founder & GP, Global Ventures (VC platform, portfolio support)</li></ul>
**Executive-Side Value (their own agent)**
Each partner executive receives a personal agent trained to think and work like them — to save time and automate their own workflow. Typical automations include inbox triage, meeting briefs, memo/deck first drafts, speech outlines, Q&A prep, and follow-ups, all in the executive’s voice and style. Controls include explicit approvals, redaction, and opt-in data ingestion for privacy.</p><p>
<ul><li>Ola Doudin — Co-founder & CEO, BitOasis (fintech, regulatory navigation)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Elie Habib — Co-founder & CTO, Anghami (consumer media, growth in MENA)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Imran Sayeed — MIT (digital transformation, product/tech strategy)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Disrupt executives — portfolio platform, growth, and operating leaders</li></ul></p><p>Note: Names are illustrative targets for outreach; not implying partnerships.</p><p></p><p>**Boardroom Agent (Advisor/Board integration)**
Position a high‑value executive agent as a standing advisor or “virtual board member.” Companies get always‑on access to the agent for strategic questions, prep, and scenario reviews without calendar bottlenecks.</p><p>**Human Approval Premium (AI + Human)**
For key decisions, customers can request the actual human executive to review and approve the agent’s proposed plan. This blends AI speed with human credibility and accountability — an exclusive, premium workflow.</p><p></p><p>**Imagine:**
* Claire Hughes Johnson–style operating cadence and decision rhythm installed in a single afternoon
* Casey Winters–caliber growth and scaling playbook tailored to your org in hours
* A finance superbrain that thinks like a Fortune 50 CFO stress-testing your model overnight</p><p>**Not a generic AI assistant.** Each CSweet agent is a distilled genius — trained to think, prioritize, and advise like the human it's modeled after.</p><p>---</p><p><h3>✨ 4.
