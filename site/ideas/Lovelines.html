Step into the story</p><p>---</p><p>**❌ The Problem**</p><p>For **readers & fans (B2C)**:</p><p>* Modern attention spans are short, but the appetite for connection and story is timeless.</p><p>* Books feel static in an instant-message world. Social feeds give quick dopamine hits but lack depth and emotional payoff.</p><p>* Interactive fiction exists, but it’s clunky, game-like, and fails to become a daily habit.</p><p>For **authors & IP owners (B2B)**:</p><p>* Publishing royalties are slow and small. In 2022, the median author earned **$2,000/year** from books alone — rising to just **$5,000 total** including all related writing work.</p><p>* Only a small fraction make a living from their craft: the average self-published author earns **$12,800/year**, established authors up to **$24,000**, and even romance writers (the top-earning genre) average just **$31,725/year**.</p><p>* Fan engagement is fragmented, and adapting IP into interactive experiences is expensive, technical, and out of reach for most creators.</p><p>* Random AI chatbots fail to engage — lacking compelling narrative arcs, emotional stakes, and consistent character voices — making them shallow, forgettable, and ineffective.</p><p>---</p><p>**💡 The Insight**  
 Text messaging is the most addictive digital format in the world — it’s personal, intimate, and habitual.</p><p>* **23B+** texts are sent daily worldwide</p><p>* U.S. teens exchange **\~237 notifications/day**, with messaging dominating</p><p>* Texting is a **$200B/year industry**</p><p>* PinkKiwi’s early Lovelines app achieved **20 sessions/user on average**, **4 sessions/day** (2× industry average), and a **72.5% story completion rate** — proving that narrative-driven text experiences hook users deeply.</p><p>The secret? **Story**. Strong narrative arcs, emotional beats, and compelling characters turn messaging into an addictive, emotionally charged experience — something AI alone can’t deliver.</p><p>---</p><p>**🚀 The Solution: Lovelines**
