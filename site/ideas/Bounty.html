<h1>Love Bounty</h1></p><p><h3>Put a price on love, and let the network deliver.</h3></p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>❌ 1. The Problem</h3></p><p> Swiping culture is broken: Dating apps reduce people to quick judgments, fostering superficiality, ghosting, and endless churn.
 Expensive alternatives are out of reach: Elite matchmakers charge $10K–$100K+ for curated introductions — far beyond the reach of most singles.
 Limited reach: One matchmaker’s network is finite; intros often fail due to misaligned expectations.
 Singles want meaningful introductions, but current options are either shallow apps or prohibitively expensive services.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💡 2. The Insight</h3></p><p>Love is priceless, but matchmaking doesn’t have to be. Instead of relying on algorithms or one gatekeeper, we crowdsource love itself. By putting a bounty on the right match, singles tap into the collective intelligence and reach of the network — friends, acquaintances, and strangers who might know (or be) the perfect fit.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🚀 3. The Solution</h3></p><p>A dating marketplace where singles post a bounty for love — and the network competes to deliver.</p><p>How it works:
1) Set your bounty (e.g., $100–$5,000)
2) Define your criteria (values, lifestyle, goals)
3) Control anonymity (blurred photos, partial bio, or open)
4) The hunt begins: network submits potential matches; higher bounties unlock more reach</p><p><hr/>
5. Winning match, winning payout → If a match works (defined by milestones like verified date, exclusivity, relationship length), the bounty is paid to the matchmaker.</p><p>For users:</p><p> Singles get a serious pool of curated intros with skin in the game.</p><p> Friends & connectors get rewarded for setting people up successfully.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🔥 Why It Works</h3></p><p> Skin in the game: Money signals intent. Bounties attract serious matches, not casual swipes.</p><p> Network effects: Instead of one matchmaker, you get hundreds.</p><p> Democratizes access: High-quality matchmaking without the $20K+ gatekeeping.</p><p> Engages communities: Friends, coworkers, even strangers can become connectors — spreading reach exponentially.</p><p> Shared success: Both sides win when love wins.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🌍 Market Opportunity</h3></p><p> Dating apps: $8B+ global market (Match Group alone valued at $45B).</p><p> Matchmaking industry: Tens of thousands of matchmakers charging $5K–$100K for elite services, with limited reach.</p><p> Loneliness economy: U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness an epidemic; people are actively investing in connection and relationships.</p><p>Love Bounty sits at the intersection of dating apps and matchmaking — blending the scalability of platforms with the quality of curated intros.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💰 Business Model</h3></p><p> Transaction fee: % cut of every bounty paid out (e.g., 15–20%).</p><p> Premium tiers: Pay more to set higher bounties, unlock more match submissions, or get priority placement.</p><p> Verification services: Paid ID checks, profile validation, and milestone tracking for match payouts.</p><p> Enterprise / Concierge: White-glove services for higher bounties, with coaching \+ relationship experts bundled in.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⚙️ Implementation Strategy</h3></p><p>1. MVP launch: Simple web app where singles post bounties \+ basic matchmaking flow.</p><p>2. Trust layer: Add verified profiles, escrow system for bounties, and milestone-based payouts.</p><p>3. Community building: Seed with influencers, “super-connectors,” and dating coaches as bounty hunters.</p><p>4. Scale: Build mobile app with gamified leaderboard of top matchmakers.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⏳ Why Now</h3></p><p> Swiping fatigue is at its peak; millions crave depth, not dopamine hits.</p><p> Matchmaking is trending upward, but underserved for the mid-market.</p><p>* The idea of bounties \+ marketplaces is proven in gig economy (Upwork, Fiverr, TaskRabbit) — Love Bounty applies it to the most valuable market of all: relationships.</p><p></p></main>
