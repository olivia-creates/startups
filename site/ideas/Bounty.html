<h1><strong>Love Bounty</strong></h1></p><p><h3>Put a price on love, and let the network deliver.</h3></p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>❌ 1. The Problem</h3></p><p><em> <strong>Swiping culture is broken:</strong> Dating apps reduce people to quick judgments, fostering superficiality, ghosting, and endless churn.
</em> <strong>Expensive alternatives are out of reach:</strong> Elite matchmakers charge $10K–$100K+ for curated introductions — far beyond the reach of most singles.
<em> <strong>Limited reach:</strong> One matchmaker’s network is finite; intros often fail due to misaligned expectations.
</em> Singles want meaningful introductions, but current options are either shallow apps or prohibitively expensive services.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💡 2. The Insight</h3></p><p>Love is priceless, but matchmaking doesn’t have to be. Instead of relying on algorithms or one gatekeeper, we crowdsource love itself. By putting a bounty on the right match, singles tap into the collective intelligence and reach of the network — friends, acquaintances, and strangers who might know (or be) the perfect fit.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🚀 3. The Solution</h3></p><p>A dating marketplace where singles post a bounty for love — and the network competes to deliver.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>
1) Set your bounty (e.g., $100–$5,000)
2) Define your criteria (values, lifestyle, goals)
3) Control anonymity (blurred photos, partial bio, or open)
4) The hunt begins: network submits potential matches; higher bounties unlock more reach</p><p><hr/>
<ol><li><strong>Winning match, winning payout</strong> → If a match works (defined by milestones like verified date, exclusivity, relationship length), the bounty is paid to the matchmaker.</li></ol></p><p><strong>For users:</strong></p><p><em> Singles get a <strong>serious pool of curated intros</strong> with skin in the game.</p><p></em> Friends & connectors get rewarded for setting people up successfully.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🔥 Why It Works</h3></p><p><em> <strong>Skin in the game:</strong> Money signals intent. Bounties attract serious matches, not casual swipes.</p><p></em> <strong>Network effects:</strong> Instead of one matchmaker, you get <em>hundreds</em>.</p><p><em> <strong>Democratizes access:</strong> High-quality matchmaking without the $20K+ gatekeeping.</p><p></em> <strong>Engages communities:</strong> Friends, coworkers, even strangers can become connectors — spreading reach exponentially.</p><p><em> <strong>Shared success:</strong> Both sides win when love wins.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🌍 Market Opportunity</h3></p><p></em> <strong>Dating apps:</strong> $8B+ global market (Match Group alone valued at $45B).</p><p><em> <strong>Matchmaking industry:</strong> Tens of thousands of matchmakers charging <strong>$5K–$100K</strong> for elite services, with limited reach.</p><p></em> <strong>Loneliness economy:</strong> U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness an epidemic; people are actively investing in connection and relationships.</p><p>Love Bounty sits at the <strong>intersection of dating apps and matchmaking</strong> — blending the scalability of platforms with the quality of curated intros.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💰 Business Model</h3></p><p><em> <strong>Transaction fee:</strong> % cut of every bounty paid out (e.g., 15–20%).</p><p></em> <strong>Premium tiers:</strong> Pay more to set higher bounties, unlock more match submissions, or get priority placement.</p><p><em> <strong>Verification services:</strong> Paid ID checks, profile validation, and milestone tracking for match payouts.</p><p></em> <strong>Enterprise / Concierge:</strong> White-glove services for higher bounties, with coaching \+ relationship experts bundled in.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⚙️ Implementation Strategy</h3></p><ol><li><strong>MVP launch:</strong> Simple web app where singles post bounties \+ basic matchmaking flow.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>Trust layer:</strong> Add verified profiles, escrow system for bounties, and milestone-based payouts.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>Community building:</strong> Seed with influencers, “super-connectors,” and dating coaches as bounty hunters.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>Scale:</strong> Build mobile app with gamified leaderboard of top matchmakers.</li></ol><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⏳ Why Now</h3></p><p><em> Swiping fatigue is at its peak; millions crave depth, not dopamine hits.</p><p></em> Matchmaking is trending upward, but underserved for the mid-market.</p><p>* The idea of <strong>bounties \+ marketplaces</strong> is proven in gig economy (Upwork, Fiverr, TaskRabbit) — Love Bounty applies it to the most valuable market of all: relationships.</p><p></p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>📉 Unit Economics</h3></p><ul><li>Sides of the marketplace: Singles (demand) and Matchmakers/Connectors (supply)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pricing: user‑set bounty, typical range $100–$5,000; white‑glove concierge $10k–$50k</li></ul>
<ul><li>Platform take rate: 15–20% of bounty paid on milestone (e.g., verified first date → 10%, exclusivity → +5%, 3‑month relationship → +5%)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Escrow & milestones: funds held in escrow; programmatic release on verified events</li></ul>
<ul><li>Fraud & quality controls: ID + selfie verification, duplicate‑intro checks, dispute mediation</li></ul>
<ul><li>Unit example (mid‑market bounty $1,000):</li></ul>
  - Gross bounty paid: $1,000
  - Platform take @ 18%: $180
  - Payment + KYC costs: ~$18 (1.8%)
  - Trust & safety + support: ~$12
  - Contribution margin: ~$150 (15%)
<ul><li>Acquisition assumptions (early market):</li></ul>
  - CAC (single): $35–$90 via IG/TikTok creators + PR; conversion 3–6%
  - CAC (connector): $10–$25 via referral incentives (“bring 3 intros, get $50 credit”)
  - LTV (single): $220–$600 (multiple cycles, higher bounties over time)
  - LTV/CAC: 2.5–5.0x target after month 6
<ul><li>Liquidity levers: seed with dating coaches + “super‑connectors,” bounty pools for specific cities/verticals (e.g., doctors, engineers)</li></ul><p><hr/></p><p><h3>✨ Tagline</h3></p><p>Put a price on love — pay when love lands.
