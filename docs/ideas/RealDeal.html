RealDeal
 Sell what you love, earn as you go.</p><p><hr/></p><p>❌ The Problem
 The world is full of products worth sharing, but distribution is broken.</p><p> Creators want to share the things they genuinely love — but affiliate programs are scattered, clunky, and hard to join.</p><p> Small businesses (and even big ones) struggle to reach audiences as ads get more expensive, algorithms shift, and trust in traditional channels erodes.
   There’s no single, seamless place where product owners and promoters meet in a simple, fair, and automated way.</p><p><hr/></p><p>💡 The Insight
 Distribution is the real currency of growth. When creators can effortlessly monetize what they already share, and businesses can tap into a network of passionate promoters, sales feel natural — not forced. The future is not buying ads, it’s fueling authentic voices.</p><p><hr/></p><p>🚀 The Solution: RealDeal
