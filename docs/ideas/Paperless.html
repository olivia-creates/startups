 But receipts are also a key touchpoint—perfect for loyalty, expense tracking, and frictionless returns.  
 A mobile-first, interactive receipt system turns paper clutter into a powerful digital asset.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🚀 The Solution: Mobill</h3></p><p>Mobill is a smart, paperless receipt hub that reimagines the receipt as a functional digital tool.</p><p>For Consumers:</p><p> Receipts “print” directly to your phone via QR, SMS, email, or app.</p><p> Swipe to categorize—business, personal, warranty, returns—instantly.</p><p> Search, tag, and export for expense reports or tax prep with one tap.</p><p> Interactive receipts include loyalty points, promotions, future discounts, and alerts.</p><p> Secure storage, retrievable anytime, eliminating clutter and loss.</p><p>For Businesses:</p><p> Eliminate printing costs and waste.</p><p> Drive repeat purchase via embedded offers.</p><p> Gain permissioned data for personalized marketing and CRM.</p><p> Reduce fraud and returns pain with verifiable digital receipts.</p><p> Sync with accounting systems to reduce admin overhead.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>✨ Why It Works</h3></p><p> Sustainable: Cuts waste, conserves resources, avoids harmful chemicals.</p><p> Convenient: No more lost receipts, no shoebox clutter.</p><p> Smart: Receipts become dynamic tools for engagement, retention, and expense tracking.</p><p> Win-win: Consumers get convenience and savings; businesses gain loyalty and efficiency.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>📊 Unit Economics</h3></p><p> Cost of paper receipts:</p><p>   Average $0.01–0.015 per receipt (paper, ink, printers, maintenance).</p><p>   For a retailer issuing 10,000 receipts/month, that’s $100–150/month in recurring costs.</p><p> Cost of Mobill:</p><p>   SaaS pricing \~$49–99/month for SMEs, scaling with volume.</p><p>   Eliminates printing costs entirely \+ saves on maintenance & device downtime.</p><p> Upside: Each digital receipt doubles as a marketing and loyalty asset, generating incremental sales uplift (2–5%) through embedded promotions.  
   👉 Instead of being a cost center, receipts become a revenue driver.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🌍 Market Opportunity</h3></p><p> Digital receipts market: \~$2.1B (2023) → $5.1B by 2033 (CAGR \~11.5%).</p><p> Expense tracking & receipts tools: $1.28B in 2024 → $5B by 2032 (CAGR \~16%).</p><p> 86% of consumers prefer digital receipts; governments are beginning to ban paper receipts unless requested, accelerating adoption.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💰 Business Model</h3></p><p> B2B SaaS for Retailers & SMEs</p><p>   Monthly subscription, cheaper than paper costs, with ROI on loyalty campaigns.</p><p> Consumer Freemium App</p><p>   Free: storage & search.</p><p>   Premium: AI auto-sorting, tax report exports, QuickBooks/Expensify integration.</p><p> Data Insights (Opt-in)</p><p>   Aggregated, anonymized analytics for brands and payment platforms.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⚙️ Implementation Strategy</h3></p><p>1.

Retail Chains: Target supermarkets, pharmacies, and electronics retailers for scale.</p><p>4. Consumer Growth: Incentivize users with loyalty offers and cashback directly in Mobill.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⏳ Why Now</h3></p><p> 90% of receipts trashed within a week → massive consumer pain \+ ecological disaster.</p><p> Printing costs are a hidden expense retailers are eager to cut.</p><p> Paperless adoption is legally and socially accelerating.</p><p>* Businesses urgently need new ways to increase loyalty and margin—Mobill flips a sunk cost into a growth engine.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>✨ Tagline</h3></p><p>“Mobill — Paperless possibilities.”</p><p></p></main>
