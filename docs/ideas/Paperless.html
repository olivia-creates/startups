 But receipts are also a key touchpoint—perfect for loyalty, expense tracking, and frictionless returns.

   👉 Instead of being a cost center, receipts become a revenue driver.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>🌍 Market Opportunity</h3></p><p> Digital receipts market: \~$2.1B (2023) → $5.1B by 2033 (CAGR \~11.5%).</p><p> Expense tracking & receipts tools: $1.28B in 2024 → $5B by 2032 (CAGR \~16%).</p><p> 86% of consumers prefer digital receipts; governments are beginning to ban paper receipts unless requested, accelerating adoption.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>💰 Business Model</h3></p><p> B2B SaaS for Retailers & SMEs</p><p>   Monthly subscription, cheaper than paper costs, with ROI on loyalty campaigns.</p><p> Consumer Freemium App</p><p>   Free: storage & search.</p><p>   Premium: AI auto-sorting, tax report exports, QuickBooks/Expensify integration.</p><p> Data Insights (Opt-in)</p><p>   Aggregated, anonymized analytics for brands and payment platforms.</p><p><hr/></p><p><h3>⚙️ Implementation Strategy</h3></p><p>1.
