# **Love Bounty**

### ***Put a price on love, and let the network deliver.***

---

### **❌ 1. The Problem**

* **Swiping culture is broken:** Dating apps reduce people to quick judgments, fostering superficiality, ghosting, and endless churn.
* **Expensive alternatives are out of reach:** Elite matchmakers charge $10K–$100K+ for curated introductions — far beyond the reach of most singles.
* **Limited reach:** One matchmaker’s network is finite; intros often fail due to misaligned expectations.
* Singles want meaningful introductions, but current options are either shallow apps or prohibitively expensive services.

---

### **💡 2. The Insight**

Love is priceless, but matchmaking doesn’t have to be. Instead of relying on algorithms or one gatekeeper, we crowdsource love itself. By putting a bounty on the right match, singles tap into the collective intelligence and reach of the network — friends, acquaintances, and strangers who might know (or be) the perfect fit.

---

### **🚀 3. The Solution**

A dating marketplace where singles post a bounty for love — and the network competes to deliver.

**How it works:**
1) Set your bounty (e.g., $100–$5,000)
2) Define your criteria (values, lifestyle, goals)
3) Control anonymity (blurred photos, partial bio, or open)
4) The hunt begins: network submits potential matches; higher bounties unlock more reach

---
5. **Winning match, winning payout** → If a match works (defined by milestones like verified date, exclusivity, relationship length), the bounty is paid to the matchmaker.

**For users:**

* Singles get a **serious pool of curated intros** with skin in the game.

* Friends & connectors get rewarded for setting people up successfully.

---

### **🔥 Why It Works**

* **Skin in the game:** Money signals intent. Bounties attract serious matches, not casual swipes.

* **Network effects:** Instead of one matchmaker, you get *hundreds*.

* **Democratizes access:** High-quality matchmaking without the $20K+ gatekeeping.

* **Engages communities:** Friends, coworkers, even strangers can become connectors — spreading reach exponentially.

* **Shared success:** Both sides win when love wins.

---

### **🌍 Market Opportunity**

* **Dating apps:** $8B+ global market (Match Group alone valued at $45B).

* **Matchmaking industry:** Tens of thousands of matchmakers charging **$5K–$100K** for elite services, with limited reach.

* **Loneliness economy:** U.S. Surgeon General declared loneliness an epidemic; people are actively investing in connection and relationships.

Love Bounty sits at the **intersection of dating apps and matchmaking** — blending the scalability of platforms with the quality of curated intros.

---

### **💰 Business Model**

* **Transaction fee:** % cut of every bounty paid out (e.g., 15–20%).

* **Premium tiers:** Pay more to set higher bounties, unlock more match submissions, or get priority placement.

* **Verification services:** Paid ID checks, profile validation, and milestone tracking for match payouts.

* **Enterprise / Concierge:** White-glove services for higher bounties, with coaching \+ relationship experts bundled in.

---

### **⚙️ Implementation Strategy**

1. **MVP launch:** Simple web app where singles post bounties \+ basic matchmaking flow.

2. **Trust layer:** Add verified profiles, escrow system for bounties, and milestone-based payouts.

3. **Community building:** Seed with influencers, “super-connectors,” and dating coaches as bounty hunters.

4. **Scale:** Build mobile app with gamified leaderboard of top matchmakers.

---

### **⏳ Why Now**

* Swiping fatigue is at its peak; millions crave depth, not dopamine hits.

* Matchmaking is trending upward, but underserved for the mid-market.

* The idea of **bounties \+ marketplaces** is proven in gig economy (Upwork, Fiverr, TaskRabbit) — Love Bounty applies it to the most valuable market of all: relationships.
