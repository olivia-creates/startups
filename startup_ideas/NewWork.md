**NewWork**
 Work at the speed of AI.

---

**❌ The Problem**
 AI is great at doing, but humans still need to guide, approve, and refine its thinking.
 Right now, that collaboration feels clunky:

* AI asks the same questions over and over

* Human input happens in scattered tools and endless chat threads

* Workflows remain hidden, repetitive, and inefficient
   In an era of AI-human collaboration, we need a way to *enjoy* the process, not drown in it.

---

**💡 The Insight**
 The future of work isn’t AI replacing humans — it’s AI making humans *more creative*. The key is frictionless collaboration where decisions, approvals, and refinements feel engaging, even fun. Gamification keeps people motivated while the system learns from them, reducing repetitive asks and streamlining work over time.

---

**🚀 The Solution: NewWork**
 NewWork turns AI-human collaboration into a game you *want* to play.

* Swipe right or left on AI’s suggested actions to refine your agent’s decision-making (Tinder for work decisions)

* See your **TaskTrust Meter** grow as AI learns your style and grows in confidence to make decisions on your behalf (a simple progress bar encourages people to do what’s needed to grow it)

* Track an **Efficiency Score**, tasks left, and “freedom unlocked” as work gets done faster (can compare with other employees how many tasks are completed per day)

* Use **voice commands** while walking to guide AI and approve work in real time

* AI maps your workflow visually and textually, catching repetitive patterns so you never answer the same thing twice


Imagine:

* Approving the perfect client reply in seconds while commuting

**🏹 Ideal Customer Avatar**

- Cross‑functional teams 5–200 people; founders, PMs, producers drowning in approvals

---

**🧭 Competitors & Alternatives**

- Notion/Asana/Jira + ad‑hoc docs; AI assistants without workflow context

**⚔️ Competitor Analysis (Differentiation)**

| Vector | NewWork | PM Suites | AI Assistants |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decisioning | Built‑in | External | Suggest-only |
| Evidence | TaskTrust meter | None | Opaque |
| Flow | Cross‑tool | Siloed | Siloed |

**📈 Marketing & Growth Strategy**

- Product-led: free tier + “Win the Meeting” challenge; creator ops channels

---

**🚦 Distribution Channels**

- Slack/Email add-ins; browser app; enterprise SSO

---

**🌱 PLG Loops & Viral Mechanics**

- Shareable decision receipts; team invites to unlock automations

---

**🛡️ Risks & Mitigation**

- Change resistance → embed in existing flows; privacy → on‑prem/keys vault

---

**📉 Predictive Financials & Metrics**

- $12–$49 user/month; CAC $8–$25; LTV $144–$588; payback <3 months

**🎯 Storytelling Layer**

- Slogan: “Ship faster with fewer meetings.”
- Header: “Decide, delegate, deliver.”
- Sub‑header: “From decisions to done — one flow.”


* AI auto-sending the right onboarding doc without asking — because it learned from you

* Watching your dashboard turn green as efficiency climbs and tasks vanish

---

**🔥 Why It Works**

* Turns approvals and refinements into an addictive, swipe-based experience

* Builds a trust loop: the more you guide AI, the smarter it gets

* Visual workflow mapping \+ pattern detection kills repetitive work

* Voice-first design supports mobility and flow

* Gamification keeps engagement high and adoption sticky

---

**🌍 Market Opportunity**

* $16B+ global productivity software market, growing fast with AI integration

* Enterprises seeking to maximize ROI from AI tools by increasing human adoption

* Knowledge workers spend 20–40% of their day on repetitive approvals and process work

---

**💰 Business Model**

* Subscription SaaS for individuals and teams

* Enterprise licensing with custom AI agent training

* Marketplace for workflow templates and productivity “skins”

---

**⏳ Why Now**
 AI has outpaced our ability to integrate it fluidly into human work. Tools today either automate too much (risking trust) or too little (wasting time). NewWork strikes the balance, making human guidance *fun*, *fast*, and *freeing*.
