## **🌍 Flagstone (or Conquest / GlobalGem)**

*See the world’s opportunities, not just its listings.*

---

### **❌ The Problem**

* Real estate sites today are **purely transactional**: photos, price, neighborhood, maybe comps.

* But investors want **context**:

  * Is this city growing in population?

  * Are new railways, airports, or policies boosting its value?

  * What’s the climate risk, rental demand, and economic outlook?

* Without this context, investors rely on brokers with conflicts of interest or spend **months researching markets manually**.

* Entry barriers are high: to invest in property abroad, you often need **hundreds of thousands of dollars** and layers of legal help.

### **💡 The Insight**

Investment isn’t just about a house—it’s about the **story around it**.
 Macro trends, local culture, incentives, and even weather patterns shape returns.
 If we **layer context onto listings** and let people **co-invest at scale**, real estate becomes more transparent, exciting, and accessible.
