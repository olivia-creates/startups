## **🌍 Flagstone (or Conquest / GlobalGem)**

*See the world’s opportunities, not just its listings.*

---

### **❌ The Problem**

* Real estate sites today are **purely transactional**: photos, price, neighborhood, maybe comps.

* But investors want **context**:

  * Is this city growing in population?

  * Are new railways, airports, or policies boosting its value?

  * What’s the climate risk, rental demand, and economic outlook?

* Without this context, investors rely on brokers with conflicts of interest or spend **months researching markets manually**.

* Entry barriers are high: to invest in property abroad, you often need **hundreds of thousands of dollars** and layers of legal help.

### **💡 The Insight**

Investment isn’t just about a house—it’s about the **story around it**.
 Macro trends, local culture, incentives, and even weather patterns shape returns.
 If we **layer context onto listings** and let people **co-invest at scale**, real estate becomes more transparent, exciting, and accessible.

---

### **🚀 The Solution: GlobalGem**

A real estate investment platform that **maps context onto listings** and enables **fractional co-investment**.

* **Flag the World**: Users can explore an interactive globe, see “hot zones” of growth, and “plant their flag” by investing.

### **📉 Unit Economics**

- Revenue streams: 1–2% transaction fee on GMV + premium analytics ($49–$199/mo) + developer SaaS
- Example: $10k average ticket × 2,000 investors × 1.2 deals/year = $24M GMV → platform fee @1.5% = $360k; SaaS + premium = additional $500k ARR
- Data licensing costs scale with regions; blended gross margin target 65–75%
- CAC: $120–$300 via content + partnerships with developers; LTV: $450–$1,200 (fees + subs)
- Liquidity strategy: seed “context‑rich” regions, curate 50 high‑quality listings/month to focus demand
