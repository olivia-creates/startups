# **Walky Walky**

### ***Turn every walk into a safe and delightful journey.***

---

### **❌ 1. The Problem**

Most map apps optimize for speed, not safety or joy:
- They can route people (especially solo women) through dark, empty, or higher‑risk areas because they prioritize ETA over security.
- They ignore personal interests and micro‑moments: vegan snacks, gelato, watches, bookstores, parks, scenic streets.
- Local businesses struggle to reach nearby pedestrians at the right moment with the right incentive.
- Result: stressed travelers, avoidable risk, and missed discovery and commerce along the way.

---

### **💡 2. The Insight**

Walking isn’t just about A→B; it’s about how it feels along the way. Safety, lighting, foot traffic, and personal interests matter. By blending multi‑objective routing (safety + delight + time) with preference‑aware points of interest (POIs) and opt‑in offers, we can make walking the default, delightful choice.

---

### **🚀 3. The Solution**

Walky Walky is a safety‑ and delight‑aware walking map that personalizes routes and surfaces on‑route POIs you’ll love.

Core features:
- Safety‑first routing: avoids poorly lit, low‑foot‑traffic, and higher‑incident streets; day/night modes; event‑aware rerouting.
- Preference overlays: vegan, gelato, watches, cafés, parks, bookstores, architecture, waterfronts; auto‑learns likes/dislikes.
- On‑route discovery: tasteful pins/cards for POIs and micro‑experiences; quick detour suggestions within time tolerance.
- Business incentives: nearby merchants can send walk‑in promos (opt‑in, on‑route only, with frequency caps and quality controls).
- Traveler mode: city “starter packs” with neighborhoods, scenic loops, and local safety notes.
- Community signals: live foot traffic density, recent reports, lighting quality, and “feel” ratings.
- Privacy by design: on‑device preference profile; no sale of personal location data; merchant offers are context‑only.

---

### **✨ 4. Why It Works**

- Minimizes risk and stress by modeling safety explicitly, not as an afterthought.
- Increases walking satisfaction via personalized micro‑discoveries along the way.
- Drives incremental, attributable foot traffic for local businesses at the exact right moment.
- Builds habit: good walks compound — users keep choosing the safer, nicer route.

---

### **⏳ 5. Why Now**

- Richer urban data (lighting, incidents, mobility) is increasingly available via open data and partners.
- Pedestrian‑friendly cities and post‑pandemic walking culture are rising.
- Tourists seek authentic discovery over speed; solo‑travel among women is growing.
- Local commerce recovery needs smarter, privacy‑respecting foot‑traffic tools.

---

### **📊 6. Market Opportunity**

- Global navigation & mapping: $30B+; local discovery/ads: $150B+; urban safety tech growing.
- Travelers: 1.4B international arrivals (pre‑pandemic) recovering; tens of millions walkable‑city residents.
- Local merchants spend heavily on proximity campaigns; few tools target pedestrians on‑route with real context.

---

### **🏹 7. Ideal Customer Avatar**

- Primary users: Solo women travelers; city walkers; students and young professionals; lifestyle walkers.
- Secondary: Tourists planning scenic days; wellness walkers tracking steps with enjoyment.
- Buyers/partners (B2B): Local cafés/retail, DMO/tourism boards, BIDs/downtown alliances, safety NGOs, city data programs.

---

### **🧭 8. Competitors & Alternatives**

- Google/Apple Maps (speed‑first), Citymapper (transit‑first), Yelp/Tripadvisor (listing‑first), Foursquare (POI), safety apps (bSafe, Citizen), and “do nothing” (wing it, unsafe shortcuts).

- Safety Model: Multi‑objective routing (time, incident density, lighting, activity, “feel”); day/night mode.
- Personalization: On‑device profile; federated learning for global model without raw location sharing.
- Rollout: City 1–3 pilots → expand to 10; merchant self‑serve beta in pilot cities.

---

### **🛡️ 15. Risks & Mitigation**
