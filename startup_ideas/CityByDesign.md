# **City By Design**

### ***Blueprinted local prosperity, powered by data.***

---

### **❌ 1. The Problem**

Most brick‑and‑mortar businesses fail or underperform because they start from founder bias rather than evidence.

* Trial‑and‑error concept selection, menus, decor, and pricing
* Fragmented, hard‑to‑use data (foot traffic, demographics, spend, tourism)
* Municipalities and developers struggle to curate the “right mix” of anchors
* Lenders can’t underwrite on standardized, location‑specific operating plans

**Proof points (US):**
* ~20% of SMBs fail in year 1; ~50% by year 5 (SBA/BNP Paribas synth)
* F&B median net margins 3–10%; small errors erase profit
* Downtowns face 10–25% retail vacancy post‑COVID in many metros
* Franchises with playbooks outperform independents on survival

---

### **💡 2. The Insight**

Local business success is patternable. The same cluster blueprints (grocery/market → bakery/coffee → family casual → maker culture → weekend events) win across climates and cultures—when tuned to hyperlocal data. Treat a neighborhood like a portfolio; curate anchors and operators to match demand signatures, then hand people evidence‑backed playbooks.

---

### **🚀 3. The Solution**

City By Design is an AI‑assisted planning platform that:

1) Evaluates locations for growth potential (climate, culture, tourism, mobility, demography, spend, foot‑traffic flows)
2) Matches them with proven “blueprints” of community anchors and concepts
3) Generates business plans, brand kits, menus/decor specs, staffing models, and operating manuals—for humans to start and run
4) Aligns municipalities, developers, lenders, and entrepreneurs on a shared, de‑risked plan

Deliverables per concept:
* Demand model (catchment + seasonality) and 24‑month pro forma
* Brand kit (name options, logo directions, palette, voice)
* Menu/Merch plan, pricing bands, sourcing guide
* Floor plan zoning, decor/materials board, CAPEX budget
* Staffing, SOPs, checklists, supplier list, health/safety
* Lender‑ready packet (assumptions, sensitivity, break‑even)

#### Pilot Location: Asheville, North Carolina (USA)

Why Asheville
* Climate: Four seasons, mild; year‑round outdoor/tourism
* Culture: Farm‑to‑table, arts scene, craft breweries, maker economy
* Tourism: ~10M+ annual visitors in region; Blue Ridge Parkway gateway
* Growth: Strong in‑migration; healthy median income growth

Proposed Anchor Blueprint (River Arts District / South Slope corridor)
1. Blue Ridge Produce Market — Cute fruit & local produce market (tourist‑friendly)
   * Rev: $150–250k/mo peak summer; $80–120k/mo off‑season
   * Gross margin 30–35% (mix of produce, packaged local goods)
2. Laurel & Loaf — Wholesome bakery with one signature hero product
   * Rev: $80–140k/mo; 12–18% net pre‑debt at scale
3. Peregrine Coffee — Third‑wave coffee + light breakfast
   * Rev: $70–110k/mo; high margin beverages; cross‑traffic driver
4. Trailhead Bikes & Tours — Rentals, guided rides, merch
   * Rev: $60–100k/mo in season; events in shoulder months
5. Fern & Found — Home & plant boutique (local makers)
   * Rev: $40–80k/mo; complements foot‑traffic dwell time
6. Little Spruce — Family play studio + weekend craft markets
   * Rev: $25–50k/mo; community glue + recurring memberships

District Impact (steady‑state, Yr 2)
* Aggregate monthly revenue: $425k–730k; annual $5.1–$8.8M
* Direct jobs: 55–85; indirect jobs (supply, tours, markets): 30–50
* Vacancy absorption: 15–25k sq ft; spillover to adjacent streets
* RE uplift: 8–15% lease rate improvement vs. baseline

---

### **✨ 4. Why It Works**

**Behavioral drivers**
* Curated anchors create predictable foot‑traffic loops
* Familiar formats with local flair reduce choice risk
* Story‑driven brands raise willingness‑to‑pay

**Risk reduction**
* Data‑led siting, pricing, menu mix, hours, and staffing
* SOPs and supplier kits shrink execution variance
* Sensitivity and contingency playbooks pre‑baked

---

### **⏳ 5. Why Now**

* Data abundance (mobility, payments, tourism, real estate) + mature AI
* Downtown recovery pressure; funds for revitalization
* Rising rents/CAPEX demand higher planning precision
* Lenders and cities want standardized underwriting packages

---

### **📊 6. Market Opportunity**

**TAM (US focus initially):**
* Retail + F&B SMB spend on planning/launch ops: ~$25–40B/yr
* Municipal/Developer placemaking + consulting: ~$15B/yr
* Proptech/location intelligence software: ~$12B/yr

**SAM:**
* 200 pilot metros; 2,000 districts; 50k concepts over 5 years → $3–5B

**SOM (5‑yr target):**
* 2% of SAM → $60–100M ARR potential + $20–40M services/royalties

---

### **🏹 7. Ideal Customer Avatar**

Primary: Municipalities, downtown alliances, and mixed‑use developers
* Need a data‑led tenant/anchor strategy and measurable impact

Secondary: Lenders and CDFIs
* Need standardized, location‑specific plans to reduce default risk

Tertiary: Aspiring operators (humans!)
* Want a proven playbook without risking life savings on guesswork

---

### **🧭 8. Competitors & Alternatives**

* Traditional consulting (placemaking, retail leasing strategy)
* Franchise systems (playbooks but limited local uniqueness)
* Location intelligence tools (no end‑to‑end operating plans)
* Generic AI plan generators (not grounded in real world ops)
* SBDCs/score mentors (great but non‑productized)

---

### **⚔️ 9. Competitor Analysis (Differentiation)**

| Feature | City By Design | Traditional Consultants | Franchises | Data Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Siting + Ops in one | Yes | Partial | Yes | No |
| Local uniqueness | High | Medium | Low | N/A |
| Speed / Cost | Fast, productized | Slow, bespoke | Medium | Fast, shallow |
| Lender packet | Standardized | Custom | Yes | No |

### **💰 10. Business Model**

Revenue streams
1) SaaS (municipalities/developers)
   * Starter $1,500/mo (1 district, 5 concepts)
   * Growth $5,000/mo (3 districts, 20 concepts, lender packets)
   * Enterprise $15,000+/mo (multi‑city, APIs, custom data)
2) Per‑project “Blueprint Packs” ($25k–$150k per district)
3) Licensing/Royalty (optional) 1–3% of net sales per concept for 24 months
4) Marketplace (suppliers, fixtures, signage, POS): 5–10% referral/wholesale margin
5) Data products for lenders/RE owners (benchmarks, risk scores)

Unit economics (illustrative)
* Gross margin SaaS 85%+, Services 45–60%, Marketplace 25–35%
* CAC (enterprise) $20–60k; Payback < 9 months; Net NRR 120%+

---

### **📈 11. Marketing & Growth Strategy**

GTM
* Pilot with 3–5 cities/developers; publish before/after case studies
* Partner with CDFIs/lenders to pre‑approve blueprint packets
* Conference circuit: ICSC, ULI, Downtown orgs; thought leadership
* "District in a Box" demo booths; live menu/decor generators

Channels
* Direct enterprise sales; RFP responses; partner referrals
* Content: district teardown reports; blueprint spotlights; webinars

---

### **🚦 12. Distribution Channels**

* Direct (website + sales) for cities/developers/lenders
* Channel partners: POS vendors, architects, fixture suppliers, banks
* APIs/embeds into lender underwriting and developer portals

---

### **🌱 13. PLG Loops & Viral Mechanics**

* Public “City Cards” with blueprint scores → shareable
* Operator showcase pages → attract lenders and suppliers
* Supplier marketplace bundles → one‑click cart for buildouts
* Community events calendar → recurring foot‑traffic loops

---

### **⚙️ 14. Implementation Strategy**

Tech/Data
* Data lake: mobility/foot‑traffic, card spend, census/ACS, tourism, weather/climate (NOAA), POI (OSM/Google), real estate (listings/leases)
* Models: demand estimation, cluster fit, pricing, labor scheduling
* Stack: Python/TypeScript, Postgres, DuckDB, dbt; Next.js app; vector search
* Integrations: Stripe, QuickBooks/Xero templates, Square/Toast POS, ArcGIS

Phases
1) MVP (6 months): Location scoring, 6 anchor blueprints, pro formas, lender packet
2) V1 (12 months): Decor/menu generators, supplier marketplace, staffing/SOPs
3) V2 (18 months): Multi‑district portfolio planning, lender API, outcomes feedback loop

Human‑in‑the‑loop
* Regional experts validate assumptions, vendor lists, and code compliance

---

### **🛡️ 15. Risks & Mitigation**

* Data gaps/accuracy → Triangulate sources; human validation; pilot surveys
* Operator execution variance → Training modules; onsite coaching network
* Regulatory hurdles → Code checklists; local A/E partners; permit playbooks
* Community pushback → Workshops; local maker inclusion; affordability goals
* Macro shocks (tourism, rents) → Stress tests; contingency menus/hours

---

### **📉 16. Predictive Financials & Metrics**

Pricing & projections (5 years)
* Yr1: 5 pilots → $2.5M rev (mix SaaS/services)
* Yr3: 40 districts live → $18–25M rev; GM 70%+
* Yr5: 150 districts → $70–100M rev; Marketplace 15–25% of total

Key metrics
* Blueprint adoption rate; time‑to‑opening; opening success rate
* GMV across concepts; job creation; vacancy absorption; RE uplift
* Lender approval rate; default rate vs. market; payback period
* Net revenue retention; margin by module; marketplace take rate

Break‑even: Month 24 under base case
