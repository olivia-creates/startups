Step into the story

**❌ The Problem**

For **readers & fans (B2C)**:

* Modern attention spans are short, but the appetite for connection and story is timeless.

* Books feel static in an instant-message world. Social feeds give quick dopamine hits but lack depth and emotional payoff.

* Interactive fiction exists, but it’s clunky, game-like, and fails to become a daily habit.

For **authors & IP owners (B2B)**:

* Publishing royalties are slow and small. In 2022, the median author earned **$2,000/year** from books alone — rising to just **$5,000 total** including all related writing work.

* Only a small fraction make a living from their craft: the average self-published author earns **$12,800/year**, established authors up to **$24,000**, and even romance writers (the top-earning genre) average just **$31,725/year**.

* Fan engagement is fragmented, and adapting IP into interactive experiences is expensive, technical, and out of reach for most creators.

* Random AI chatbots fail to engage — lacking compelling narrative arcs, emotional stakes, and consistent character voices — making them shallow, forgettable, and ineffective.

---

**💡 The Insight**
 Text messaging is the most addictive digital format in the world — it’s personal, intimate, and habitual.

* **23B+** texts are sent daily worldwide

* U.S. teens exchange **\~237 notifications/day**, with messaging dominating

* Texting is a **$200B/year industry**

* PinkKiwi’s early Lovelines app achieved **20 sessions/user on average**, **4 sessions/day** (2× industry average), and a **72.5% story completion rate** — proving that narrative-driven text experiences hook users deeply.

The secret? **Story**. Strong narrative arcs, emotional beats, and compelling characters turn messaging into an addictive, emotionally charged experience — something AI alone can’t deliver.

**🚀 The Solution: Lovelines**
 Lovelines transforms stories into immersive, text-message-based experiences — with **authors** at the creative core.

**For Readers (B2C app):**

* Step into a character’s world — receive texts, photos, and voice notes as if they’re messaging *you*.

* Make choices at key inflection points that branch the story toward one of multiple endings.

* Replay for alternate outcomes, keep favorite conversations, and share your “story receipts” with friends.

* Daily “drop” format keeps you hooked and coming back.

**For Authors & IP Owners (B2B platform):**

* Upload manuscripts or outlines into the Lovelines Author Studio.

* Define characters’ personalities, tones, and response logic.

* Map branching arcs visually — no coding required.

* Publish directly to the Lovelines marketplace or integrate into your own app.

* Monetize via in-app sales, subscriptions, or brand partnerships.
