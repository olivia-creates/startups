### **❌ The Problem**

Dating apps are noisy, shallow, and exhausting:

* Endless swiping & ghosting → low success rates.

* Busy professionals feel unsafe, burned out, and disillusioned.

* Matchmakers charge $10k–$50k+ but still have limited networks.

* Time wasted on repetitive “getting-to-know-you” convos that go nowhere.
