# **Vesta**

### ***Get returns on your rent.***

---

### **❌ 1. The Problem**

Renting in Dubai is expensive and unrewarding:
- Average annual rent for a 2-bedroom: AED 60–85K (~USD 16–23K)
- Many tenants are expats who cannot buy immediately due to visa, capital, or regulatory friction
- Paying rent with credit cards adds interest costs on top of already high rents
- Unlike mortgages, renting is a pure sunk cost — no equity, no financial benefit
- Landlords face arrears, fraud risk, and high turnover in transient expat markets

---

### **💡 2. The Insight**

Rent doesn’t need to be a dead cost. If tenants could earn modest financial returns on rent payments (instead of losing money to credit card interest and missing out on equity), while landlords gained safer, verified income — renting could become a smarter, fairer financial vehicle.

---

### **🚀 3. The Solution**

Vesta transforms rent into a secure, rewarding, and community-driven experience.

For Tenants:
- Get returns on your rent (2–4% APR) versus the losses of credit card interest and the sunk cost of not owning real estate assets
- Verified properties & landlords → fraud prevention and trust
- Liquidity: withdraw early for emergencies or roll forward into next month
- Credit buffer: short-term loans if rent can’t be paid
- Expat services: orientation (banking, healthcare, culture), visa/legal guidance, vetted rental contract reviews
- Automatic invite to local WhatsApp/Telegram community groups for events, integration, and networking

For Landlords:
- Verified tenants with background & credit checks
- Escrow-backed on-time payments, even if tenants delay
- Reduced risk of arrears or eviction
- Analytics dashboard on tenant behaviors and payment trends
- Happier tenants → longer stays, lower churn

---

### **✨ 4. Why It Works**

- Tenants win: modest returns versus the double penalty of (1) credit card interest and (2) renting without building equity
- Landlords win: safer payments, better tenants, and reduced vacancy
- Market wins: a modern, transparent layer over a massive global rental economy

---

### **⏳ 5. Why Now**

- Dubai rents grew 16% YoY in 2024
- Expats make up ~92% of Dubai’s 4M residents (~3.5M people) — highly transient, highly rent-dependent
- Global expat population: 300M+, growing rapidly
- Salaries flat, costs rising: pressure on renters to find smarter solutions
- No major platform today combines financial yield + security + expat services

---

### **📊 6. Market Opportunity**

- Global residential rental market: $1.56T (2023) → $2.56T by 2032
- Dubai rental transactions: ~AED 200B annually (~USD 54B)
- Expansion markets:
  - London: ~$130B rental market, 16% foreign-born population
  - Singapore: ~$40B rental market, 38% foreign-born
  - New York City: ~$120B rental market, ~36% foreign-born (~3M)
- SOM (Year 3, Dubai): AED 2.5B (~USD 680M) processed rent flows

---

### **🏹 7. Ideal Customer Avatar**

- Tenants: Expats, 25–45, professionals, $60–200K income, need flexibility, value smarter financial tools & community
- Landlords: Real estate groups, property managers, Airbnb operators needing reliable tenants & payments

---

### **🧭 8. Competitors & Alternatives**

- Traditional rent: sunk cost, no return
- Credit card rent payments: expensive, with high interest charges
- Deposit insurance: narrow use-case
- Rent-to-own: complex, not suited to transient expats
- Ohana/sublet platforms: focus on finding rentals, not financial benefits
