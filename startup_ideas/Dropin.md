## **Dropin**

*Turn every café into a co-working space.*

---

### **❌ The Problem**

* **Remote work is the new normal:** \~23% of U.S. employees (36M people) work remotely at least part-time【Backlinko】. Globally, hybrid models are here to stay.
* In Q1 2025, **41% of U.S. jobs** featured some form of remote work—24% hybrid and 13% fully remote. That’s up significantly from just 10% remote two years earlier.[Oyster HR+6Robert Half+6StrongDM+6](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/research/remote-work-statistics-and-trends?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Telework remains prominent**: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that as of Q1 2024, nearly **22.9% of workers** performed some telework, up from 21.5% in early 2023\.

* **Cafés are under strain:**

  * *Unlimited Wi-Fi freeloading* → squatters block seats without buying.

  * *Strict time caps* → frustrate paying customers mid-session.

  * *Dry logins* → miss opportunities to upsell, retain, or build community.

* Result: lost revenue per seat, reduced turnover, and customers feeling unwanted.

### **💡 The Insight**

Every café seat is valuable real estate.
 With the right system, cafés can become **micro co-working spaces** — balancing turnover, boosting revenues, and fostering community while addressing the **loneliness crisis** among remote workers.

---

### **🚀 The Solution: Dropin**

Dropin transforms café Wi-Fi into a **pay-to-stay coworking system**:

**For Customers:**

* Buy a drink → unlock Wi-Fi for 1.5 hours.

* 5 mins before expiry: a friendly pop-up offers to:

  * **Add more time** with a micro-payment to extend wifi time, or

  * **Order a snack/drink** (delivered to your seat) to extend time proportionally to amount paid.

* Optional café chat with a forum or Slack-like network → connect with other remote workers, fostering friendships and networking.

**For Cafés:**

* Control seat usage with flexible time tiers.

* Increase sales through upsells tied to Wi-Fi & seating.

* Turn empty Wi-Fi into **recurring coworking revenue**.

* Build loyalty and community around the café brand.

---

### **🔥 Why It Works**

* **Stops freeloading, honors paying customers.**

* **Boosts profit per square foot:** a latte \+ a croissant mid-session doubles average ticket.

* **Loyalty & community:** patrons feel like members, not just transactions.

* **Scalable:** No need for new furniture or staffing, just software.

### **✨ Tagline**

“Dropin — Your pass to work, connect, and belong.”

Could extend it beyond coffee shops, a mutli service wifi network that connects people, workers, beyond just having wifi as a cheap commodity with weird password.

The password used can be designed and sold as an ad: “Caramelfrappucino” \- makes you want to buy it, or think of it at least.
