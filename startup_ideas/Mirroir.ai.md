# **Mirroir.ai**

### ***See it. Feel it. Own it.***

---

### **‚ùå 1. The Problem**

E-commerce today is detached and impersonal. Shoppers scroll past generic product photos of models who don't look like them, in settings they can't relate to. These images don't always inspire, and they don't convert. There's no emotional connection ‚Äî no sense of ownership.

**Proof points:**
* 70% of online fashion purchases are returned due to fit/style issues
* Average e-commerce conversion rate is only 2.86% for fashion
* 64% of consumers say they want to see products on people who look like them
* Traditional product photography costs $500-2000 per item for brands

---

### **üí° 2. The Insight**

**People are more likely to buy when they can already see themselves owning the product.** Emotional proximity ‚Äî the feeling that "this is mine" ‚Äî drives desire and action. But today's e-commerce experiences don't offer that. They're passive, not personal.

**The overlooked truth:** Shopping isn't just about function ‚Äî it's about identity and aspiration. When customers can visualize themselves living with a product, purchase intent skyrockets.

---

### **üöÄ 3. The Solution: Mirroir.ai**

Mirroir.ai reinvents online shopping by letting users see **themselves** in every product photo ‚Äî styled in aspirational, cinematic environments that reflect the life they want to live.

Template-first generation (to reduce compute and raise quality):
* Brand-approved layered template scenes (background, lighting rigs, product passes, occlusion mattes)
* Personalize only the person layer and local blend zones (wrist, hand, shoulder, neck) with fast post-processing for lighting/shadows
* Adjust color grading and reflections without re-generating the entire frame

Category wedge (luxury-first):
* Start with accessories: watches, handbags, jewelry, eyewear, shoes ‚Äî precise local compositing, fewer drape/fit issues
* Next: outerwear and dresses in constrained poses and curated scenes
* Later: full apparel with dynamic fit after template and pose control mature

Identity-forward UX:
* Fewer products, one-by-one, with 3‚Äì5 hero scenes per product
* Narrative scenes that merge identity and product to trigger desire

**Core Features:**
* **Personal AI Photoshoots**: Upload 1‚Äì2 photos once; reuse across all scenes
* **Template Scenes**: Yacht golden hour, Paris rooftop, gallery opening, etc.
* **Local Fit & Relight**: Believable contact shadows, highlights, micro-reflections
* **Social Sharing**: Instantly shareable looks optimized for social media
* **Brand Integration**: Seamless embedding in any e-commerce platform

üõë This isn't a virtual try-on tool.
‚úÖ It's a **hyper-personalized, scene-based shopping experience** that builds emotional ownership by depicting *you* living with the product ‚Äî before you ever buy it.

---

### **‚ú® 4. Why It Works**

**Behavioral Drivers:**

* **Social Proof**: Seeing yourself in aspirational settings builds confidence

**Emotional Hooks:**

* **You are the model**: radically personalized and representative
* **Dreamlike environments** enhance desire and storytelling

* **Zero-friction**: Integrated into brand sites or used via browser/app on any store

**Evidence of Adoption:**
* Visual commerce drives 40% higher conversion rates than text-based
* Personalized experiences increase purchase likelihood by 80%
* User-generated content drives 6.9x higher engagement than brand content

### Agent Evaluation v1.1

Executive summary
Mirroir.ai reframes e‚Äëcommerce from static, impersonal grids to intimate, identity‚Äëforward scenes. The refined plan reduces compute via template‚Äëfirst generation and wedges into luxury accessories where AOV, brand control, and aspiration justify a premium, QA‚Äôd experience. With modest conversion lifts, the economics are attractive; primary risks are brand approvals/quality and consistent photoreal personalization at scale.

Problem and timing
- Problem: Shoppers can‚Äôt see themselves owning products; brands waste traffic on linear, unpersonalized flows.
- Why now: Visual AI, privacy‚Äësafe embeddings, and brand asset pipelines make template‚Äëdriven personalization feasible. Luxury brands seek novel growth post‚Äëads plateau.

Solution (refined)
- Template‚Äëfirst scenes (brand‚Äëapproved layers: background, lighting, product, occlusion) + localized personalization (wrist/hand/shoulder/neck) and post‚Äëprocessing relight.
- Identity‚Äëforward UX: 3‚Äì5 hero scenes per SKU, intimate ‚Äúone‚Äëby‚Äëone‚Äù browsing that fuses identity with product.
- Category wedge: luxury accessories ‚Üí constrained apparel ‚Üí full apparel as pose/fit control matures.

Target customers and value
- Brands (primary): Conversion lift, ATC uplift, lower returns, PR buzz; premium, QA‚Äôd storytelling.
- Consumers: Emotional resonance, representation, confidence; fewer, better choices.

Business model and unit economics (illustrative)
- Brand SaaS + credits + services. Example per brand: $5k SaaS + credits; compute ~$1.4k/mo for 30k previews/10.5k HD looks; GM > 70% before services.

Feasibility and tech plan
- 0‚Äì6 mo: pre‚Äërendered templates; high‚Äëquality segmentation/matting; localized relight; preview‚ÜíHD; identity caching.
- 6‚Äì12 mo: scene packs; constrained apparel; limited cinemagraphs.
- 24‚Äì36 mo: on‚Äëdevice previews; 2.5D identity models; real‚Äëtime scene toggles.

Luxury pilot plan highlights
- Why luxury: high AOV, curated SKUs, brand control, identity value.
- Targets: watches, fine jewelry, handbags, sunglasses, designer shoes.
- Motion: co‚Äëbranded 3‚Äì5 hero scenes/SKU line; concierge onboarding; influencer seeding; strict brand QA (logo/color/material checks).
- KPIs: preview‚ÜíHD ‚â• 35%; +12% ATC; +3‚Äì5% conversion uplift; ‚àí8‚Äì12% returns.

Risks & mitigations
- Quality: curated ‚Äúgolden poses,‚Äù better mattes, human QA at launch.
- Brand approvals: pre‚Äëapproved kits, automated checks, ‚ÄúBrand Grade‚Äù thresholds.
- Bias/representation: diverse templates; calibrated lighting.
- Privacy: on‚Äëdevice or encrypted embeddings; clear consent/deletion.
- Cost control: template‚Äëfirst workflow; cached previews; credits/quotas.

Milestones and metrics (12 months)
- 0‚Äì3 mo: 2 pilot brands; 10‚Äì15 templates/brand; consumer NPS ‚â• 50.
- 3‚Äì6 mo: 6‚Äì10 brands live; preview‚ÜíHD ‚â• 35%; +3% conversion uplift in tests.
- 6‚Äì12 mo: 15‚Äì25 brands; ‚àí10% returns on eligible SKUs; NRR ‚â• 120%.

Financial outlook (illustrative)
- Yr1: 8‚Äì12 brands ‚Üí $1.2‚Äì$2.0M ARR (SaaS+credits) + $0.3‚Äì$0.8M services; GM 65‚Äì75%.
- Yr2: 30‚Äì40 brands ‚Üí $5‚Äì$8M ARR; GM improves as services mix declines.
- Yr3: 75‚Äì100 brands ‚Üí $15‚Äì$25M ARR; video/loops uplifts; platform margins expand.

Verdict
- Product‚Äëmarket timing: Strong wedge in luxury accessories.
- Feasibility: High for accessories via template‚Äëfirst; apparel requires staged expansion.
- Revenue potential: Attractive with brand SaaS + credits; rapid payback with modest lifts.
- Go: Advance with 2‚Äì3 design‚Äëpartner pilots, prioritize QA/tooling, publish performance case studies.

Action items (next 4‚Äì6 weeks)
1) Identify and pitch 10 luxury brands across watches/jewelry/handbags; secure 2 pilot commitments.
2) Produce 10‚Äì15 brand‚Äëapproved templates per pilot (3‚Äì5 hero scenes per flagship SKU line).
3) Implement preview‚ÜíHD pipeline with identity caching; set cost telemetry per render stage.
4) Build ‚ÄúBrand Grade‚Äù QA checks (logo alignment, color/material tolerances, moir√©, clipping) and dashboards.
5) Define test design and KPIs with pilots (+ATC, conversion uplift, returns reduction) and plan for public case studies.
