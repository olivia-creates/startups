# **Mirroir.ai**

### ***See it. Feel it. Own it.***

---

### **‚ùå 1. The Problem**

E-commerce today is detached and impersonal. Shoppers scroll past generic product photos of models who don't look like them, in settings they can't relate to. These images don't always inspire, and they don't convert. There's no emotional connection ‚Äî no sense of ownership.

**Proof points:**
* 70% of online fashion purchases are returned due to fit/style issues
* Average e-commerce conversion rate is only 2.86% for fashion
* 64% of consumers say they want to see products on people who look like them
* Traditional product photography costs $500-2000 per item for brands

---

### **üí° 2. The Insight**

**People are more likely to buy when they can already see themselves owning the product.** Emotional proximity ‚Äî the feeling that "this is mine" ‚Äî drives desire and action. But today's e-commerce experiences don't offer that. They're passive, not personal.

**The overlooked truth:** Shopping isn't just about function ‚Äî it's about identity and aspiration. When customers can visualize themselves living with a product, purchase intent skyrockets.

---

### **üöÄ 3. The Solution: Mirroir.ai**

Mirroir.ai reinvents online shopping by letting users see **themselves** in every product photo ‚Äî styled in aspirational, cinematic environments that reflect the life they want to live.

**Imagine getting on your favorite brand's website and seeing *you* wearing the clothes, accessories, or items ‚Äî already living the lifestyle they represent. You are now the model. Sales happen when a customer feels seen.**

**Core Features:**
* **Personal AI Photoshoots**: Upload one photo, see yourself in any outfit
* **Lifestyle Scenes**: Aspirational environments (yacht, Paris rooftop, Amalfi coast)
* **Body Type Matching**: AI adapts to your specific measurements and proportions
* **Social Sharing**: Instantly shareable looks optimized for social media
* **Brand Integration**: Seamless embedding in any e-commerce platform

Upload a photo, height, and body type once. Then browse your favorite brands and see:
* A watch on your wrist on a yacht at golden hour
* A jacket on your frame at a rooftop bar in Paris
* A dress on you at a seaside dinner in Amalfi

üõë This isn't a virtual try-on tool.
‚úÖ It's a **fully generated, hyper-personalized AI photoshoot integrated in your shopping experience** that builds emotional ownership by depicting *you* living with the product ‚Äî before you ever buy it.

This turns each shopping session into a **vision board** experience, making every product feel already yours.
