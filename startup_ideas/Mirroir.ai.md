# **Mirroir.ai**

### ***See it. Feel it. Own it.***

---

### **❌ 1. The Problem**

E-commerce today is detached and impersonal. Shoppers scroll past generic product photos of models who don't look like them, in settings they can't relate to. These images don't always inspire, and they don't convert. There's no emotional connection — no sense of ownership.

**Proof points:**
* 70% of online fashion purchases are returned due to fit/style issues
* Average e-commerce conversion rate is only 2.86% for fashion
* 64% of consumers say they want to see products on people who look like them
* Traditional product photography costs $500-2000 per item for brands

---

### **💡 2. The Insight**

**People are more likely to buy when they can already see themselves owning the product.** Emotional proximity — the feeling that "this is mine" — drives desire and action. But today's e-commerce experiences don't offer that. They're passive, not personal.

**The overlooked truth:** Shopping isn't just about function — it's about identity and aspiration. When customers can visualize themselves living with a product, purchase intent skyrockets.

---

### **🚀 3. The Solution: Mirroir.ai**

Mirroir.ai reinvents online shopping by letting users see **themselves** in every product photo — styled in aspirational, cinematic environments that reflect the life they want to live.

Template-first generation (to reduce compute and raise quality):
* Brand-approved layered template scenes (background, lighting rigs, product passes, occlusion mattes)
* Personalize only the person layer and local blend zones (wrist, hand, shoulder, neck) with fast post-processing for lighting/shadows
* Adjust color grading and reflections without re-generating the entire frame

Category wedge (luxury-first):
* Start with accessories: watches, handbags, jewelry, eyewear, shoes — precise local compositing, fewer drape/fit issues
* Next: outerwear and dresses in constrained poses and curated scenes
* Later: full apparel with dynamic fit after template and pose control mature

Identity-forward UX:
* Fewer products, one-by-one, with 3–5 hero scenes per product
* Narrative scenes that merge identity and product to trigger desire

**Core Features:**
* **Personal AI Photoshoots**: Upload 1–2 photos once; reuse across all scenes
* **Template Scenes**: Yacht golden hour, Paris rooftop, gallery opening, etc.
* **Local Fit & Relight**: Believable contact shadows, highlights, micro-reflections
* **Social Sharing**: Instantly shareable looks optimized for social media
* **Brand Integration**: Seamless embedding in any e-commerce platform

🛑 This isn't a virtual try-on tool.
✅ It's a **hyper-personalized, scene-based shopping experience** that builds emotional ownership by depicting *you* living with the product — before you ever buy it.

---

### **✨ 4. Why It Works**

**Evidence of Adoption:**
* Visual commerce drives 40% higher conversion rates than text-based
* Personalized experiences increase purchase likelihood by 80%

### Agent Evaluation v1.1

Executive summary
Mirroir.ai reframes e‑commerce from static, impersonal grids to intimate, identity‑forward scenes. The refined plan reduces compute via template‑first generation and wedges into luxury accessories where AOV, brand control, and aspiration justify a premium, QA’d experience. With modest conversion lifts, the economics are attractive; primary risks are brand approvals/quality and consistent photoreal personalization at scale.

Problem and timing
- Problem: Shoppers can’t see themselves owning products; brands waste traffic on linear, unpersonalized flows.
- Why now: Visual AI, privacy‑safe embeddings, and brand asset pipelines make template‑driven personalization feasible. Luxury brands seek novel growth post‑ads plateau.

Solution (refined)
- Template‑first scenes (brand‑approved layers: background, lighting, product, occlusion) + localized personalization (wrist/hand/shoulder/neck) and post‑processing relight.
- Identity‑forward UX: 3–5 hero scenes per SKU, intimate “one‑by‑one” browsing that fuses identity with product.
- Category wedge: luxury accessories → constrained apparel → full apparel as pose/fit control matures.

Target customers and value
- Brands (primary): Conversion lift, ATC uplift, lower returns, PR buzz; premium, QA’d storytelling.
- Consumers: Emotional resonance, representation, confidence; fewer, better choices.

Business model and unit economics (illustrative)
- Brand SaaS + credits + services. Example per brand: $5k SaaS + credits; compute ~$1.4k/mo for 30k previews/10.5k HD looks; GM > 70% before services.

Feasibility and tech plan
- 0–6 mo: pre‑rendered templates; high‑quality segmentation/matting; localized relight; preview→HD; identity caching.
- 6–12 mo: scene packs; constrained apparel; limited cinemagraphs.
- 24–36 mo: on‑device previews; 2.5D identity models; real‑time scene toggles.

Luxury pilot plan highlights
- Why luxury: high AOV, curated SKUs, brand control, identity value.
- Targets: watches, fine jewelry, handbags, sunglasses, designer shoes.
- Motion: co‑branded 3–5 hero scenes/SKU line; concierge onboarding; influencer seeding; strict brand QA (logo/color/material checks).
- KPIs: preview→HD ≥ 35%; +12% ATC; +3–5% conversion uplift; −8–12% returns.

Risks & mitigations
- Quality: curated “golden poses,” better mattes, human QA at launch.
- Brand approvals: pre‑approved kits, automated checks, “Brand Grade” thresholds.
- Bias/representation: diverse templates; calibrated lighting.
- Privacy: on‑device or encrypted embeddings; clear consent/deletion.
- Cost control: template‑first workflow; cached previews; credits/quotas.

Milestones and metrics (12 months)
- 0–3 mo: 2 pilot brands; 10–15 templates/brand; consumer NPS ≥ 50.
- 3–6 mo: 6–10 brands live; preview→HD ≥ 35%; +3% conversion uplift in tests.
- 6–12 mo: 15–25 brands; −10% returns on eligible SKUs; NRR ≥ 120%.

Financial outlook (illustrative)
- Yr1: 8–12 brands → $1.2–$2.0M ARR (SaaS+credits) + $0.3–$0.8M services; GM 65–75%.
- Yr2: 30–40 brands → $5–$8M ARR; GM improves as services mix declines.
- Yr3: 75–100 brands → $15–$25M ARR; video/loops uplifts; platform margins expand.

Verdict
- Product‑market timing: Strong wedge in luxury accessories.
- Feasibility: High for accessories via template‑first; apparel requires staged expansion.
- Revenue potential: Attractive with brand SaaS + credits; rapid payback with modest lifts.
- Go: Advance with 2–3 design‑partner pilots, prioritize QA/tooling, publish performance case studies.

Action items (next 4–6 weeks)
1) Identify and pitch 10 luxury brands across watches/jewelry/handbags; secure 2 pilot commitments.
2) Produce 10–15 brand‑approved templates per pilot (3–5 hero scenes per flagship SKU line).
3) Implement preview→HD pipeline with identity caching; set cost telemetry per render stage.
4) Build “Brand Grade” QA checks (logo alignment, color/material tolerances, moiré, clipping) and dashboards.
5) Define test design and KPIs with pilots (+ATC, conversion uplift, returns reduction) and plan for public case studies.
